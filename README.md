================

This launcher is intended for blind people who are looking for a very easy way to use basic functions on theire phone. This launcher is not a Google's Talkback replacement. 

This Lauchner was inspired by the eyes-free shell and solves things differently. 

Currently, the following features are implemented: 

* Calling Phone Book numbers
* Enter phone number & call 
* Announce Time 

The following functions are planned: 

* Missed calls 
* Read SMS
